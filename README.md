# Martin Vicknair 👋

**Applications Support Engineer / Senior Solutions Support Advisor**  
Remote (Jalisco, Mexico) • **Bilingual: English / Spanish**

I help SaaS support teams handle complex issues with less stress and more consistency by building **structured troubleshooting workflows**, **customer-safe response frameworks**, and **practical support tooling** (often Zendesk-adjacent). I enjoy turning “messy, high-context” problems into repeatable processes, clear documentation, and lightweight automation.

---

## What I’m focused on

- **Escalation triage & root cause analysis**  
  Structured diagnostics, clear internal summaries, and step-by-step customer guidance.

- **Workflow standardization**  
  Reusable playbooks, templates, and macros that reduce rework and response variance.

- **Customer-safe automation (AI-assisted)**  
  Guardrail-first frameworks where AI drafts/structures and humans verify against source-of-truth.
